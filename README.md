# TabSync

- [ ] Implement ChatSync
- [ ] Fix skin not showing
- [ ] Add suport for colored names
- [ ] Is TabAPI really needed?
- [ ] Support for other connections?

So far this plugin uses `config.yml` to identify instances and connect to a redis host to be able to pub/sub to different events and keep all servers in sync regarding player lists and chats.
