# TabSync

So far this plugin uses `config.yml` to identify instances and connect to a redis host to be able to pub/sub to different events and keep all servers in sync regarding player lists and chats.


### Bugs & Features

- [ ] Impl config on join/quit messages for players
- [ ] Implement ChatSync
- [ ] Fix skin not showing

- [ ] Is TabAPI really needed?
